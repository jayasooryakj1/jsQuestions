41 Program to calculate Electricity Bill

    The electricity board charges different tariffs based on the unit’s consumption. 

    - Charges for first 50 units are 2.60 Rs.
    - Charges for the next 50 units are 3.25 Rs.
    - Charges for the next 100 units are 5.65 Rs.
    - And if the consumption unit is greater than 200 , charge should be 7.25
    - and there should be apply 0.5% trariff charge if the overall consumption is greater than 700 units.


42 Program to Calculate Employee Salary
    This JS program uses the Else If statement to calculate the employee’s gross salary. 

        Gross Salary = Basic salary + HRA + DA

    - If basic salary lessthan or equals to 10000, then
        hra = 8% of basic salary
        da = 10% of basic salary

    - If basic salary lessthan or equals to 20000, then
        hra = 16% of basic salary
        da = 20% of basic salary

    - If basic salary greater than 20000, then
        hra = 24% of basic salary
        da = 30% of basic salary

43 JS Program to find Volume and Surface Area of a Cone
   
        Cone Surface Area = πrl + πr² (l = length, r = radius)
        Volume of a Cone = 1/3 πr²h ( h = Cone height)
        The Lateral Surface Area of a Cone = πrl

		
44 JS Program to find Volume and Surface Area of a Cube

        Surface Area of a Cube = 6l² (l = length of any side of a Cube).
        Cube Volume = l  l  l
        The Lateral Surface Area of a Cube = 4  (l  l)

45 JS Program to find Surface Area and Volume of a Cuboid

        Total Surface Area of a Cuboid = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh, where l = length, w = width, and h = height
        Volume of a Cuboid = lbh
        The Lateral Surface Area of a Cuboid = 2h (l + w)

46 JS Program to find Volume and Surface Area of a Cylinder

        Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πr² + 2πrh (r = radius and h = cylinder height).
        Cylinder Volume = πr²h
        The Lateral Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πrh
        Cylinder Top Or Bottom Surface Area = πr²

47 JS Program to find Volume and Surface Area of a Sphere

        Sphere Surface Area = 4πr²
        The radius of a Sphere = √surface_area / 4π
        Sphere Volume = 4πr³
